## Introduction ‚ú®

This script builds on top of [Yenthe Van Ginneken's excellent and well known Odoo Install Script](https://github.com/Yenthe666/InstallScript) to make it easy and painless to setup [Odoo](https://www.odoo.com/) on a server bootstrapped using <https://github.com/engineervix/ubuntu-server-setup>

## Usage üöÄ

- First things first, this script **assumes** that your Ubuntu server has been setup using
  <https://github.com/engineervix/ubuntu-server-setup>. If this is the case ... proceed ...
- download the script from GitHub:

  ```bash
  wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/engineervix/ubuntu-odoo-setup/main/odoo_install.sh
  ```

- make your own modifications if you wish to change some things
- ensure that it's executable:

  ```bash
  chmod +x odoo-install.sh
  ```

- execute the script to install Odoo:

  ```bash
  ./odoo-install.sh
  ```

## How is this script different from Yenthe VG's? üñ•Ô∏è

The main difference is that we already have a server that's been setup with a custom user,
Nginx, certbot, PostgreSQL, Node.js, etc. So we don't wanna install these things. Further:

- we'd like to use a **virtual environment** to run Odoo
- we wanna use **Systemd** and not **init**
